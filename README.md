# Chalkboard Math Front End Repo

## Important Install Instructions

**This repo is directly tied to it's Rails backend which can be found at: https://github.com/matthewstclaire/flashcard-project-backend.** Follow the guide on that repo to clone and run a server. Without this the Chalkboard Math App will not display any questions or have the ability to save questions made.

## About

This app allows you to add basic math questions as you see fit. They are then stored in the backend which is a Rails API that I have made. You will also be able to delete questions as you see fit.
